## PWM-Controlled-LED 
This project demonstrates how to control the brightness of an LED using PWM and a button with debounce logic on an Arduino Nano.

### Compiling and Uploading

1. **Open the Sketch:**
    - Download the sketch from this repository.
    - Open the Arduino IDE.
    - Load the sketch file (PWM_LED_Fade.ino).

2. **Select the Board and Port:**
    - Go to `Tools -> Board` and select `Arduino Nano`.
    - Go to `Tools -> Processor` and select the appropriate processor (`ATmega328P` or `ATmega328P (Old Bootloader)`).
    - Go to `Tools -> Port` and select the port to which your Arduino Nano is connected.

3. **Compile the Sketch:**
    - Click the `Verify` button (checkmark icon) in the Arduino IDE to compile the sketch.

4. **Upload the Sketch:**
    - Click the `Upload` button (right arrow icon) in the Arduino IDE to upload the sketch to the Arduino Nano.
